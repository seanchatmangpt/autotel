PicosecondSPARQL Store for Autotel

High-performance RDF store implementation using PicosecondSPARQL engine
for ultra-fast semantic data storage and querying.

Key Features:
- Sub-nanosecond query performance for simple SPARQL patterns
- Microsecond-scale performance for complex analytical queries
- Seamless integration with Autotel's store ecosystem
- Memory-efficient storage with configurable resource limits
- Real-time data ingestion with immediate query availability

Store Interface:
Following Autotel's BaseStore pattern with enhanced performance:
- store(): Efficient RDF triple storage with indexing
- retrieve(): High-speed data retrieval using SPARQL patterns
- query(): Direct SPARQL query execution with optimization
- delete(): Efficient data removal with index maintenance

Performance Characteristics:
- Simple pattern queries: <1ns execution time
- Complex analytical queries: <1Î¼s execution time
- Data ingestion: >1M triples/second throughput
- Memory usage: Optimized for large-scale RDF datasets
- Concurrent access: Thread-safe with minimal contention

Data Formats:
- RDF triples (subject, predicate, object)
- Named graphs for context-aware storage
- SPARQL result sets for query responses
- Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML for import/export
- JSON-LD for web-compatible data exchange

Storage Features:
- Automatic indexing for optimal query performance
- Incremental updates with immediate query availability
- Efficient bulk loading for large datasets
- Memory-mapped storage for large-scale data
- Configurable persistence and durability options

Integration Points:
- PicosecondSPARQL engine for query execution
- Autotel telemetry for performance monitoring
- Configuration management through Autotel schemas
- Error handling with Autotel exception patterns
- Resource pooling for concurrent access

Use Cases:
- High-performance semantic data storage
- Real-time RDF data ingestion and querying
- Knowledge graph storage and navigation
- Semantic data integration and federation
- Large-scale analytical queries on RDF data

Query Capabilities:
- Full SPARQL 1.1 support with performance optimization
- Federated queries across multiple data sources
- Streaming results for large result sets
- Parallel query execution for complex analytics
- Query optimization using semantic patterns

Configuration Options:
- Storage backend selection (memory, disk, hybrid)
- Index configuration and optimization settings
- Memory limits and resource management
- Query timeout and performance thresholds
- Persistence and backup strategies

Quality Assurance:
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Comprehensive testing with standard RDF test suites
- Performance benchmarking against established stores
- Concurrent access testing and validation
- Data consistency and durability verification
