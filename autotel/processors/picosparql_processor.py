PicosecondSPARQL Processor for Autotel

High-performance SPARQL processor that provides sub-nanosecond query execution
for semantic reasoning tasks in Autotel workflows.

Key Features:
- Sub-nanosecond SPARQL query execution for simple patterns
- Microsecond-scale performance for complex analytical queries
- Seamless integration with Autotel's processor ecosystem
- Batch processing capabilities for high-throughput scenarios
- Dynamic query generation through generative assembly

Performance Characteristics:
- ASK queries: <1ns execution time (simple patterns)
- SELECT queries: <10ns execution time (basic patterns)
- Complex queries: <1Î¼s execution time
- Batch processing: >1M queries/second throughput
- Memory efficient with configurable resource limits

Processor Interface:
Following Autotel's standard processor patterns with enhanced performance:
- process(): Main processing method with telemetry integration
- configure(): Configuration validation and engine initialization
- validate(): Input validation with semantic checking
- cleanup(): Resource management and optimization

Input Data Formats:
- Direct SPARQL query strings
- Structured query specifications with parameters
- Template references with dynamic parameter substitution
- Semantic fragment compositions for modular queries
- Batch query collections for bulk processing

Output Data Formats:
- Standard SPARQL result sets (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Autotel-compatible structured data
- Streaming results for real-time processing
- Performance metrics and execution statistics
- Error reports with detailed diagnostics

Integration Points:
- Autotel telemetry and span tracking
- Configuration management through Autotel schemas
- Error handling with Autotel exception patterns
- Logging integration with structured output
- Resource pooling for multi-threaded environments

Use Cases in Workflows:
- Semantic validation in data processing pipelines
- Real-time pattern matching in monitoring systems
- Complex analytical queries in reporting workflows
- Data consistency checking in ETL processes
- Integration with external semantic knowledge bases

Configuration Options:
- Engine performance tuning (cache sizes, batch sizes)
- Query timeout and resource limits
- Telemetry and monitoring settings
- Error handling and retry policies
- Memory management and cleanup intervals

Thread Safety:
Designed for concurrent use in multi-threaded Autotel environments
with proper resource isolation and performance optimization.
