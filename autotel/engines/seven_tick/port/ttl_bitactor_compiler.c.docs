File: ttl_bitactor_compiler.c

Purpose:
This file implements a TTL (Turtle) to BitActor compiler, demonstrating the core concept of defining the entire system in TTL and compiling it within a 7-tick constraint. It includes a simplified TTL parser, bytecode generation logic, and functions for managing the compilation context, parsing TTL, compiling behaviors and entanglements, deploying to the BitActor matrix, and validating the "Specification = Execution" principle.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is a **core component of the CNS AOT Compiler**. Its functions are fundamental to the CNS's ability to translate high-level TTL specifications into low-level, deterministic BitActor code.

1.  **Core CNS AOT Compiler Component:**
    *   `parse_ttl_line`: This simplified TTL parser is a crucial part of the AOT compiler's front-end. A production AOT compiler would have a more robust and complete TTL parser, but the principles of fixed-time parsing are demonstrated here.
    *   `ttl_opcode_from_predicate`: This mapping logic is essential for translating semantic predicates into BitActor opcodes. This mapping would be defined in the CNS ontology (TTL) and used by the AOT compiler.
    *   `ttl_generate_behavior_bytecode`: This function demonstrates how TTL-defined behaviors are translated into BitActor bytecode. The AOT compiler would implement this logic, ensuring the generated bytecode adheres to the 8T/8H/8B constraints.
    *   `ttl_generate_entanglement`: Similar to behavior bytecode generation, this function shows how entanglement definitions from TTL are compiled.
    *   `ttl_bitactor_compiler_create`, `ttl_bitactor_parse`, `ttl_bitactor_compile`, `ttl_bitactor_deploy`, `ttl_bitactor_execute`, `ttl_apply_dark_80_20`, `ttl_validate_specification_equals_execution`, `ttl_bitactor_get_metrics`, `ttl_bitactor_compiler_destroy`: These functions collectively define the interface and core logic of the AOT compiler. Their implementation, especially the parts related to fixed-time execution and deterministic output, are central to the CNS AOT compiler.

2.  **CNS Core Framework (Utility/Integration):**
    *   The `rdtsc()` implementation (though simplified here) is a utility that would be part of the CNS core framework for performance measurement.
    *   The `meta_probe_begin_span` and `meta_probe_end_span` calls demonstrate integration with the L4 Meta-Probe layer, which is a CNS core framework component.

**Conclusion:**
`ttl_bitactor_compiler.c` is a highly relevant and critical file for the CNS. Its functions directly represent the core logic of the CNS AOT compiler, demonstrating how TTL specifications are transformed into executable BitActor code under strict timing constraints. The concepts and algorithms within this file are central to the CNS's competitive advantage.
