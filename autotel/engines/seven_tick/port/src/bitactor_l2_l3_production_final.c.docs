File: src/bitactor_l2_l3_production_final.c

Purpose:
This file presents a "final production" implementation of the L2 (Routing) and L3 (GenActor) layers of the BitActor stack. It focuses on high-performance, optimized message passing, actor processing, and includes features like circuit breakers, priority queues, and multi-threading (via pthreads). It also contains extensive benchmarking and permutation testing to validate its performance targets (sub-100ns routing, sub-200ns processing).

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file represents a **highly optimized, production-ready implementation of core CNS framework components**. While it's presented as a standalone "production final" version, its functionalities are directly analogous to the L2 Fiber Engine and L3 Contract Resolver concepts we've discussed, but with a more robust, multi-threaded, and fault-tolerant design.

1.  **Core CNS Framework Components:**
    *   **L2 Routing (`L2Router`, `l2_router_init`, `l2_route_message`, `l2_dequeue_message`):** This is a more advanced and production-grade implementation of the L2 Fiber Engine's message dispatch and mailbox management. Its lockless operations and cache-aligned structures are critical for CNS performance. This code should be integrated into the CNS core framework.
    *   **L3 GenActor System (`L3System`, `GenActor`, `ActorBehavior`, `l3_system_init`, `genactor_process`, `l3_worker_thread`):** This represents a sophisticated implementation of the L3 Contract Resolver's role in executing actor behaviors. The `GenActor` concept, `ActorBehavior` function pointers, and the multi-threaded worker model are key elements for the CNS. This code should be integrated into the CNS core framework.
    *   **Circuit Breaker (`CircuitBreaker`, `circuit_breaker_allow`, `circuit_breaker_success`, `circuit_breaker_failure`):** This is a crucial fault-tolerance mechanism. Its branchless (or minimal-branch) design and atomic operations are highly relevant for the CNS's deterministic fault handling. This should be a core CNS framework component.
    *   **Bidirectional Channel (`BidirectionalChannel`, `channel_init`, `channel_send_*`, `channel_receive_*`):** This provides efficient inter-layer communication. Its lockless, ring-buffer-based design is suitable for the CNS framework.
    *   **Utilities (`get_nanoseconds`, `crc32_fast`, `hash_actor_id`):** These are essential low-level utilities that should be part of a general CNS utility library.

2.  **AOT-Generated Logic (Integration Points):**
    *   The `ActorBehavior` function pointers (`handle_call`, `handle_cast`) within `GenActor` are the direct integration points for AOT-generated actor behaviors. The AOT compiler would generate the specific C functions that implement these behaviors based on TTL, and then populate these function pointers.
    *   The `Message` structure defines the communication protocol. The AOT compiler would need to understand this structure to generate code that correctly constructs and processes messages.

3.  **Example/Test/Utility:**
    *   `main()`: The `main` function, along with `benchmark_l2_routing`, `benchmark_l3_processing`, and `run_permutation_tests`, are **benchmarking and demonstration code**. They should be kept separate as tests/examples and not included in the core CNS framework.
    *   `ProductionSystem`: This top-level structure is for orchestrating the benchmark and could be adapted for a high-level CNS system test, but not necessarily part of the core framework.

**Conclusion:**
`src/bitactor_l2_l3_production_final.c` is a highly valuable file. It contains production-grade implementations of L2 and L3 functionalities that are essential for the CNS core framework. Its design principles (lockless, cache-aligned, multi-threaded) align well with the CNS's performance goals. The AOT compiler would generate code that integrates with these framework components.
