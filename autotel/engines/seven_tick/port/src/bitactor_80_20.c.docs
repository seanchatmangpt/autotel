File: src/bitactor_80_20.c

Purpose:
This file serves as a simplified, "80/20" prototype and benchmark for core BitActor functionalities, including a basic execution hot path, matrix ticking, actor/domain management, and conceptual cognitive reasoning hops. It also contains simplified implementations of registry and entanglement bus, along with TTL compilation and hashing utilities.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is primarily a demonstration and benchmarking artifact. Its core logic should be re-expressed in Turtle (TTL) and generated by the AOT compiler, while its simplified CNS framework components are redundant with dedicated, optimized CNS core libraries.

1.  AOT-Generated Logic (from TTL):
    *   `bitactor_execute_hot_path`: The core L1 execution logic for actors. This should be defined in TTL (e.g., as part of a Behavior's bytecode) and generated by the AOT compiler.
    *   `bitactor_matrix_tick`: The logic for advancing the BitActor matrix, including iterating over domains and actors. The AOT compiler would generate unrolled loops for this based on the system's defined scale.
    *   `bitactor_domain_create`, `bitactor_add_to_domain`: The instantiation and configuration of domains and actors should be driven by TTL definitions, with the AOT compiler generating the necessary setup calls.
    *   `hop_trigger_detect`, `hop_state_resolve`, `hop_collapse_compute`, `hop_ontology_load`, `hop_shacl_fire`, `hop_action_bind`, `hop_state_commit`, `hop_meta_validate`, `execute_cognitive_cycle`: These cognitive reasoning "hops" and their orchestration are prime candidates for definition in TTL. The AOT compiler would generate their branchless, fixed-cycle C implementations.
    *   `bitactor_nanoregex_match`: If nano-regex is a core part of BitActor's runtime, its logic should be defined in TTL and generated by AOT.
    *   `bitactor_feed_actor_update`: This specific actor behavior should be defined in TTL and generated by AOT.

2.  CNS Core Framework (Redundant/Refactored):
    *   `bitactor_registry_init`, `bitactor_registry_register_actor`, `bitactor_registry_lookup_actor`: These are simplified versions of the L6 Registry. The optimized L6 Registry (`registry.c`) should be used as the CNS core framework component.
    *   `bitactor_entanglement_bus_init`, `bitactor_entanglement_bus_propagate_signal`: These are simplified versions of the L7 Entanglement Bus. The optimized L7 Entanglement Bus (`src/entanglement_oracle.c`) should be used as the CNS core framework component.
    *   `rdtsc()` simulation: The CNS framework should provide a robust, platform-specific cycle counter abstraction.
    *   `simple_rand()`: If a deterministic RNG is needed, it should be part of the CNS framework.
    *   `bitactor_matrix_create`, `cns_bitactor_create`, `cns_bitactor_destroy`, `cns_bitactor_execute`: These functions represent the top-level system management and could be part of the CNS framework's system initialization/teardown.

3.  AOT Compiler Logic (Not Runtime):
    *   `compile_ttl_to_bitactor`, `create_bitactor_manifest`, `hash_ttl_content`, `hash_bytecode`, `bitactor_nanoregex_compile`: These functions are part of the AOT compilation process (TTL parsing, hashing, and C code generation). Their logic belongs in the AOT compiler (`cjinja_aot_compiler.py`) or a dedicated TTL parsing/compilation library, not in the runtime C code.

4.  Example/Test/Utility:
    *   `benchmark_bitactor_80_20`, `benchmark_l6_l7_permutations`: These are benchmark functions and should remain as separate test/example code, not part of the core CNS framework or AOT-generated code.
    *   `emit_performance_metrics`: This is a utility for reporting and could be part of a CNS diagnostic tool.

Overall, `src/bitactor_80_20.c` serves as a valuable reference for the *kind* of logic that needs to be implemented, but its direct inclusion in the CNS runtime would lead to redundancy and a violation of the AOT-driven design. Its core concepts should be translated into TTL for AOT generation.
