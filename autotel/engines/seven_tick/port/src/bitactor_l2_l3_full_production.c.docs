File: src/bitactor_l2_l3_full_production.c

Purpose:
This file provides a comprehensive, "full production" implementation of the L2 (Routing) and L3 (GenActor) layers. It expands significantly on `bitactor_l2_l3_production_final.c` by incorporating advanced features like distributed tracing, message persistence (via mmap), consistent hashing for routing, dead-letter queues, and more sophisticated error recovery and self-healing mechanisms. It aims for robust, high-performance, and fault-tolerant operation in a production environment, with detailed performance targets and extensive benchmarking.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file represents the **most complete and production-ready implementation of core CNS framework components** for L2 and L3. Its advanced features and robust design make it highly suitable for direct integration into the CNS core framework.

1.  **Core CNS Framework Components:**
    *   **ProductionL2Router (`ProductionL2Router`, `l2_router_init`, `l2_route_message`, `l2_dequeue_message`):** This is the definitive L2 implementation for the CNS. Its consistent hashing, priority queues, dead-letter queues, and integration with circuit breakers are essential.
    *   **ProductionL3System (`ProductionL3System`, `GenActor`, `GenActorBehavior`, `l3_system_init`, `genactor_process_message`, `l3_worker_thread`):** This is the definitive L3 implementation. The `GenActor` lifecycle, behavior callbacks, supervision strategies, and multi-threaded worker pool are critical for the CNS.
    *   **Circuit Breaker (`CircuitBreaker`, `circuit_breaker_init`, `circuit_breaker_allow_request`, `circuit_breaker_record_success`, `circuit_breaker_record_failure`):** This is a robust, production-grade circuit breaker implementation. Its thread-safe design and state transitions are vital for CNS fault tolerance.
    *   **BidirectionalChannel (`BidirectionalChannel`, `bidirectional_init`, `bidirectional_send_*`, `bidirectional_receive_*`):** This provides the high-performance, lockless communication channels between L2 and L3.
    *   **Utilities (`get_precise_nanoseconds`, `calculate_crc32`, `generate_trace_id`, `emit_trace_event`, `consistent_hash`):** These are production-grade utilities that should be part of a general CNS utility library.
    *   **Message Structures (`ProductionMessage`, `TraceContext`):** These define the standard message format and tracing context for the CNS.

2.  **AOT-Generated Logic (Integration Points):**
    *   The `GenActorBehavior` function pointers are the primary integration points for AOT-generated actor behaviors. The AOT compiler would generate the specific C functions for `handle_call`, `handle_cast`, `init`, `terminate`, etc., based on TTL definitions, and then populate these pointers.

3.  **Example/Test/Utility:**
    *   `main()`: The `main` function, along with `benchmark_l2_routing`, `benchmark_l3_processing`, `benchmark_circuit_breaker`, and `run_permutation_tests`, are **benchmarking and demonstration code**. They should be kept separate as tests/examples and not included in the core CNS framework.
    *   `FullProductionSystem`: This top-level structure is for orchestrating the full system benchmark and could be adapted for a high-level CNS system test, but not necessarily part of the core framework.

**Conclusion:**
`src/bitactor_l2_l3_full_production.c` is a highly valuable and comprehensive file. It provides production-grade implementations of L2 and L3 functionalities that are essential for the CNS core framework. Its advanced features, performance optimizations, and fault-tolerance mechanisms align perfectly with the CNS's goals. The AOT compiler would generate code that integrates seamlessly with these robust framework components.
