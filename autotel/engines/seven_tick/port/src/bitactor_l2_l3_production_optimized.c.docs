File: src/bitactor_l2_l3_production_optimized.c

Purpose:
This file provides an "Optimized Production" implementation of the L2 (Routing) and L3 (Supervision) layers, focusing on critical bug fixes and performance enhancements over previous versions. It features optimized lock-free queues with memory barriers, proper supervisor-actor relationship initialization, and tuned backpressure mechanisms. It includes detailed performance targets and extensive benchmarking to validate its sub-100ns routing and sub-200ns supervision decision latencies.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file represents a **highly optimized and refined implementation of core CNS framework components** for L2 and L3. It builds upon the concepts in `bitactor_l2_l3_production_final.c` by addressing specific performance and correctness issues. Its robust, low-latency design makes it an excellent candidate for direct integration into the CNS core framework.

1.  **Core CNS Framework Components:**
    *   **OptimizedL2Router (`OptimizedL2Router`, `l2_router_init_optimized`, `l2_route_message_optimized`, `l2_dequeue_message_optimized`):** This is a highly optimized L2 implementation. Its use of power-of-2 capacities for queues, fast modulo operations, and atomic operations with relaxed memory ordering are crucial for 8T/8H/8B compliance. This code should be integrated into the CNS core framework.
    *   **OptimizedL3System (`OptimizedL3System`, `OptimizedGenActor`, `OptimizedSupervisor`, `l3_supervision_init_optimized`, `l3_supervision_decision_optimized`, `l3_restart_actor_optimized`, `l3_restart_all_siblings_optimized`):** This is a highly optimized L3 implementation, with a focus on correct supervisor-actor relationships and efficient supervision decisions. Its deterministic restart policies are vital for CNS reliability. This code should be integrated into the CNS core framework.
    *   **OptimizedBidirectionalChannel (`OptimizedBidirectionalChannel`, `bidirectional_init_optimized`, `bidirectional_send_*_optimized`, `bidirectional_receive_*_optimized`):** This provides highly optimized, lock-free communication channels between L2 and L3, essential for low-latency message passing.
    *   **Utilities (`get_precise_nanoseconds`, `fast_hash`, `calculate_checksum`):** These are optimized low-level utilities that should be part of a general CNS utility library.
    *   **Message Structures (`OptimizedMessage`):** This defines the optimized message format for the CNS.

2.  **AOT-Generated Logic (Integration Points):**
    *   The `OptimizedGenActor` structure and its associated behaviors would be populated by AOT-generated code, similar to the `GenActorBehavior` in `bitactor_l2_l3_full_production.c`.

3.  **Example/Test/Utility:**
    *   `main()`: The `main` function, along with `benchmark_optimized_l2_routing`, `benchmark_optimized_l3_supervision`, `benchmark_optimized_bidirectional`, and `run_optimized_permutation_tests`, are **benchmarking and demonstration code**. They should be kept separate as tests/examples and not included in the core CNS framework.
    *   `OptimizedProductionSystem`: This top-level structure is for orchestrating the benchmark and could be adapted for a high-level CNS system test, but not necessarily part of the core framework.

**Conclusion:**
`src/bitactor_l2_l3_production_optimized.c` is a very important file for the CNS. It provides highly optimized and bug-fixed implementations of L2 and L3 functionalities that are crucial for achieving the CNS's stringent performance and reliability goals. Its design principles and specific optimizations are directly applicable to the CNS core framework.
