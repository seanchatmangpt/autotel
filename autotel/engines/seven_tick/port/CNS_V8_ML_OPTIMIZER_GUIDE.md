## Performance Metrics

### ML-Specific Metrics
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted patterns
- **Optimization Efficiency**: Current Pareto efficiency (0.0-1.0)
- **Feedback Improvement Rate**: Rate of performance improvement over time
- **ML Overhead**: Percentage of cycles spent on ML operations
- **Vital Few Identified**: Count of high-value patterns found
- **Trivial Many Skipped**: Count of low-value patterns bypassed

- Properties (typically ~20%)
- Hierarchy relations (typically ~10%)
- Other patterns (typically ~20%)

## Implementation Details

### Feature Extraction (7-tick)
The ML optimizer extracts 8 features for pattern prediction:
1. **Pattern frequencies** (features 0-4): Recent occurrence of each pattern type
2. **Pattern diversity** (feature 5): Variety of patterns in recent window
3. **Transition probability** (feature 6): Likelihood of pattern repetition
4. **Sequence length** (feature 7): Context indicator

### Neural Network Architecture
- Single hidden layer with 8 inputs, 5 outputs
- Fast sigmoid activation: `x / (1.0 + |x|)`
- Weight initialization: small random values (-0.05 to 0.05)
- Bias initialization: zero
- Online training with immediate feedback

### Memory Efficiency
- Circular buffer for pattern history (100 entries per pattern)
- 8-byte aligned data structures
- Minimal overhead design (~5% typical)

## Usage Example

```c
// Initialize base and ML-enhanced loops
cns_v8_turtle_loop_t base_loop;
cns_v8_turtle_loop_init(&base_loop, 16384);

cns_v8_ml_turtle_loop_t ml_loop;
cns_v8_ml_turtle_loop_init(&ml_loop, &base_loop, 0.85); // Target 85% efficiency

// Set optimization strategy
cns_v8_set_optimization_strategy(&ml_loop, OPT_STRATEGY_ADAPTIVE);

// Process turtle data with ML optimization
char output[4096];
size_t output_size = sizeof(output);
cns_v8_ml_process_turtle(&ml_loop, turtle_data, data_size, 
                        output, &output_size);

// Get enhanced metrics
cns_v8_ml_metrics_t metrics;
cns_v8_get_ml_metrics(&ml_loop, &metrics);

printf("Pareto Efficiency: %.3f\n", metrics.optimization_efficiency);
printf("Prediction Accuracy: %.1f%%\n", metrics.prediction_accuracy * 100);
```
