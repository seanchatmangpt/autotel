File: chatman_nano_stack/chatman_topology_lifter.c

Purpose:
This file is a placeholder for `chatman_topology_lifter.c`. Based on its name and location within `chatman_nano_stack`, it is intended to implement the "Topology Lifter" component of the Chatman Nano Stack. This component would likely be responsible for lifting low-level execution traces or system topology information back into a higher-level, human-readable format (e.g., TTL), similar to the L8 "Causal Telemetry / Self-Awareness" layer.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is a **Core CNS Framework Component (L8)**. It represents the production-grade implementation of the Topology Lifter, which is crucial for the CNS's observability, debugging, and self-analysis capabilities.

1.  **Core CNS Framework Component (L8):**
    *   This file would contain the actual implementation of the L8 Topology Lifter. This would involve processing raw execution data (e.g., from `meta_probe` or other internal telemetry) and converting it into a structured, semantic representation (like TTL).
    *   The implementation would need to adhere to strict performance and determinism requirements, potentially using techniques like fixed-size buffers, branchless logic, and pre-computed mappings.

**Conclusion:**
`chatman_nano_stack/chatman_topology_lifter.c` is a critical file for the CNS. Its full implementation would provide the L8 Topology Lifter, enabling the system to "lift" its own execution and topology into a verifiable, semantic model. This is a core component of the CNS framework.
