File: chatman_nano_stack/src/bitactor_80_20.c

Purpose:
This file is a copy of `src/bitactor_80_20.c` located within the `chatman_nano_stack/src` directory. It implements a simplified, "80/20" prototype and benchmark for core BitActor functionalities, including a basic execution hot path, matrix ticking, actor/domain management, and conceptual cognitive reasoning hops. It also contains simplified implementations of registry and entanglement bus, along with TTL compilation and hashing utilities.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is a **duplicate** of `src/bitactor_80_20.c`. The recommendations for `src/bitactor_80_20.c` apply here as well.

*   **Avoid Duplication:** This file should be removed to avoid code duplication and potential inconsistencies. The canonical version should be `src/bitactor_80_20.c`.
*   **AOT-Generated Logic (from TTL):** Its core logic should be re-expressed in Turtle (TTL) and generated by the AOT compiler.
*   **CNS Core Framework (Redundant/Refactored):** Its simplified CNS framework components (Registry, Entanglement Bus) are redundant with the dedicated, optimized CNS core libraries (`registry.c`, `src/entanglement_oracle.c`, `src/l7_dark_triple_real.c`).
*   **AOT Compiler Logic (Not Runtime):** Functions related to TTL compilation and hashing belong in the AOT compiler (`cjinja_aot_compiler.py` or `ttl_bitactor_compiler.c`).
*   **Example/Test/Utility:** Benchmarking functions should remain as separate test/example code.

**Conclusion:**
This file is a duplicate and should be removed. Its relevant concepts and logic should be integrated into the CNS through TTL definitions and the CNS core framework.
