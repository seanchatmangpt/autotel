File: chatman_nano_stack/chatman_signal_decoder.c

Purpose:
This file is a placeholder for `chatman_signal_decoder.c`. Based on its name and location within `chatman_nano_stack`, it is intended to implement a "Signal Decoder" component. This component would be responsible for taking raw input signals (e.g., from hardware, network interfaces, or internal events) and deterministically decoding them into a structured format that the BitActor system can process. This is a critical step for ensuring that external inputs are correctly interpreted and integrated into the causal computation.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is a **Core CNS Framework Component (Input/Signal Processing)**. It represents a crucial, low-latency input processing layer within the CNS.

1.  **Core CNS Framework Component (Input/Signal Processing):**
    *   This file would contain the implementation of a highly optimized signal decoding mechanism. This would involve fixed-time parsing, validation, and transformation of raw input data into the CNS's internal message or signal format.
    *   It would need to adhere to strict performance and determinism requirements, ensuring that signal decoding does not introduce variable latency or non-deterministic behavior.
    *   It would likely integrate with the `chatman_fastbus.c` for routing the decoded signals.

**Conclusion:**
`chatman_nano_stack/chatman_signal_decoder.c` is a critical file for the CNS. Its full implementation would provide the deterministic signal decoding capability, essential for the CNS's real-time interaction with its environment. This is a core component of the CNS framework.
