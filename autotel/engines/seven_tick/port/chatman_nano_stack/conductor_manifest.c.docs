File: chatman_nano_stack/conductor_manifest.c

Purpose:
This file is a copy of `conductor_manifest.c` located within the `chatman_nano_stack` directory. It defines the `conductor_manifest_entry_t` structure and the `conductor_manifest` array, which maps actors to their compiled behaviors. It also includes example behavior callbacks that integrate with the `meta_probe` (L4) layer.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is a **duplicate** of `conductor_manifest.c`. The recommendations for `conductor_manifest.c` apply here as well.

*   **Avoid Duplication:** This file should be removed to avoid code duplication and potential inconsistencies. The canonical version should be `conductor_manifest.c`.
*   **AOT-Generated Logic (from TTL):** The `conductor_manifest` array and its contents (including `spec_hash`, `bytecode`, and `behavior_callbacks`) should be entirely generated by the AOT compiler based on TTL definitions of actors and their behaviors.
*   **CNS Core Framework (Integration Points):** The `conductor_manifest_entry_t` structure itself is a core CNS framework component, defining the metadata for compiled behaviors. The integration with `meta_probe` (L4) demonstrates how AOT-generated code would interact with CNS core services.

**Conclusion:**
This file is a duplicate and should be removed. Its relevant concepts and logic should be integrated into the CNS through TTL definitions and the CNS core framework.
