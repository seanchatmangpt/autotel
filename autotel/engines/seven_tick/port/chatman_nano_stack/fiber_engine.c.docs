File: chatman_nano_stack/fiber_engine.c

Purpose:
This file is a copy of `fiber_engine.c` located within the `chatman_nano_stack` directory. It implements the L2 Fiber Engine, responsible for executing bytecode streams tied to actor behavior. It interfaces with L1 (BitActor Core) for instruction execution, L3 (Contract Resolver) for dispatch logic, L8 (Topology Lifter) for telemetry, and L4 (Meta-Probe) for performance monitoring. It has been refactored to remove `if` statements for deterministic, branchless execution.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is a **duplicate** of `fiber_engine.c`. The recommendations for `fiber_engine.c` apply here as well.

*   **Avoid Duplication:** This file should be removed to avoid code duplication and potential inconsistencies. The canonical version should be `fiber_engine.c`.
*   **AOT-Generated Logic (from TTL):** The core logic of `fiber_engine_execute_fiber` and especially `execute_bytecode` (which would be fully unrolled) should be generated by the AOT compiler based on TTL definitions of actor behaviors.
*   **CNS Core Framework (Integration Points):** The `fiber_engine_execute_fiber` function itself is a core CNS framework component, orchestrating the execution of actor behaviors. Its integration with L1, L3, L4, and L8 demonstrates how AOT-generated code interacts with CNS core services.

**Conclusion:**
This file is a duplicate and should be removed. Its relevant concepts and logic should be integrated into the CNS through TTL definitions and the CNS core framework.
