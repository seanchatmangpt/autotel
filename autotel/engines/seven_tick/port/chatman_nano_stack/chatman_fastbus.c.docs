File: chatman_nano_stack/chatman_fastbus.c

Purpose:
This file is a placeholder for `chatman_fastbus.c`. Based on its name and location within `chatman_nano_stack`, it is intended to implement a "FastBus" component for signal decoding and routing, specifically a "FastPath router." This suggests a highly optimized, low-latency message or signal bus within the Chatman Nano Stack, likely operating at a very low level to ensure deterministic and rapid communication between components.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is a **Core CNS Framework Component (Communication/Routing)**. It represents a critical, high-performance communication layer within the CNS.

1.  **Core CNS Framework Component (Communication/Routing):**
    *   This file would contain the implementation of a highly optimized message or signal bus. This would involve techniques like lock-free queues, memory-mapped buffers, and potentially hardware-assisted communication.
    *   It would be responsible for deterministic signal decoding and routing, ensuring that messages reach their destinations within strict timing constraints.
    *   It would likely integrate with L2 (Fiber Engine) for message delivery and L7 (Entanglement Bus) for causal signal propagation.

**Conclusion:**
`chatman_nano_stack/chatman_fastbus.c` is a critical file for the CNS. Its full implementation would provide a high-performance, deterministic communication backbone, essential for the CNS's real-time capabilities. This is a core component of the CNS framework.
