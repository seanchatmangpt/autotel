File: bitactor_ls_benchmark.c

Purpose:
This file implements a comprehensive benchmark suite for the BITACTOR-LS (Learning System). It's designed to validate the sub-100ns performance of the learning-enhanced semantic computing, including the effectiveness of learned optimizations and adherence to Trinity compliance (8T/8H/8B). It conducts various phases: warmup, baseline measurement, learning phase (pattern discovery and optimization compilation), enhanced performance measurement, and memory efficiency analysis. It provides detailed metrics and a final assessment of production readiness.

CNS Integration Recommendation:

This file is purely a **Benchmark/Demonstration** and should **NOT** be part of the core CNS framework or AOT-generated code. It is a highly specialized test designed to validate the performance and self-optimization capabilities of the CNS's L9 Learning Layer.

1.  **Benchmark/Demonstration:**
    *   `benchmark_warmup`, `benchmark_baseline_performance`, `benchmark_learning_phase`, `benchmark_enhanced_performance`, `benchmark_memory_efficiency`, `bitactor_ls_run_comprehensive_benchmark`, `display_benchmark_results`, and `main()`: These functions are dedicated to orchestrating and reporting on the benchmark. They should remain as standalone test/example code.
    *   The `printf` statements for logging and reporting are typical of benchmark code and would not be in a production CNS component.
    *   The `test_execution_pattern_t` and `test_patterns` array are specific to the benchmark's test scenarios.

2.  **CNS Core Framework (Reference/Concepts):**
    *   This benchmark heavily relies on and tests the functions defined in `bitactor_ls_integration.c` (the L9 Learning Layer). The successful execution and positive results from this benchmark indicate that `bitactor_ls_integration.c` is a strong candidate for inclusion in the CNS core framework.
    *   The performance targets (`TARGET_SUB_100NS_RATE`, `TARGET_LEARNING_IMPROVEMENT`, `BASELINE_BITACTOR_CORE_NS`) and the metrics collected (average execution time, sub-100ns rate, learning improvement, Trinity violations, system stability, memory efficiency) are crucial for defining and validating the CNS's overall performance goals.

**Conclusion:**
`bitactor_ls_benchmark.c` is an essential test and validation tool for the CNS's advanced learning capabilities. It is not part of the deployable CNS runtime but is critical for ensuring the quality and performance of the CNS core framework's L9 Learning Layer.
