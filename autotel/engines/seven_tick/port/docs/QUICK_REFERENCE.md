## Key Functions to Port

### Micro-Operations (8T)
```c
cns_8t_hash64()           // 64-bit hash in â‰¤ 8 ticks
cns_8t_simd_lane_op()     // SIMD operation in â‰¤ 8 ticks  
cns_8t_cache_touch()      // Cache line touch in â‰¤ 8 ticks
```

### Memory Management (8M)
```c
cns_8t_arena_l1_alloc()   // L1-optimized allocation
cns_8t_arena_l1_prefetch_next()  // Strategic prefetching
cns_8t_arena_l1_apply_coloring() // Cache coloring
```

### Cache Analysis
```c
cns_8t_l1_simulate_access()  // L1 cache simulation
cns_8t_record_access()       // Access pattern tracking
cns_8t_l1_generate_optimization_report() // Recommendations
```

## Performance Targets

### Phase 1: Ground Truth
- Micro-operations: < 20 measured cycles (accounting for overhead)
- Measurement overhead: 10-15 cycles (rdtsc)
- Real workloads: Use volatile variables to prevent optimization

### Phase 2: Hardware-Resonant
- L1 cache hit rate: > 95%
- Cache conflicts: Minimized through coloring
- Memory alignment: 64-byte cache line boundaries

### Phase 3: Proven System
- Sequential access: > 500M nodes/second
- Cached node access: < 3 cycles (batch measured)
- 8T constraint: All micro-operations â‰¤ 8 cycles

## Critical Insights

### Measurement Philosophy
1. **Honest Measurement**: Account for rdtsc overhead (0-41 cycles)
2. **Multiple Samples**: Use minimum of multiple measurements
3. **Real Workloads**: Volatile variables prevent compiler optimization
4. **Batch Measurement**: Amortize overhead across multiple operations

### Micro-Operation Design
1. **8-Tick Constraint**: Every micro-operation â‰¤ 8 cycles
2. **SIMD Utilization**: 4x speedup for vectorizable operations
3. **Cache Awareness**: Design for L1 characteristics (32KB, 64-byte lines)
4. **Branch Elimination**: Zero conditional branches in hot paths

### Memory Layout Optimization
1. **Cache Line Alignment**: 64-byte alignment for major structures
2. **Spatial Locality**: Group related data together
3. **Prefetching**: Strategic use of `__builtin_prefetch`
4. **Cache Coloring**: Reduce cache set conflicts
