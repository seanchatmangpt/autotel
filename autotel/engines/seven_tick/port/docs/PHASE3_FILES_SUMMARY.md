- [ ] `Makefile` treats TTL files as dependencies for C headers
- [ ] `FINAL_80_20_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` validates AOT approach
- [ ] TTL changes automatically trigger C code regeneration

- [ ] `8H_REASONING_ARCHITECTURE.md` provides performance budgets
- [ ] System operates using 8-hop cognitive cycle as main loop

- [ ] `CNS_REALITY_CHECK.md` and `CNS_FINAL_ITERATION_SUMMARY.md` provide final verdicts
- [ ] All user commands trigger full Observe → Orient → Decide → Act cycle

## Success Criteria

### Ultimate Validation
The successful porting of Phase 3 is validated when you can:

1. **Modify a high-level TTL specification file** (e.g., change a SHACL rule)
2. **Run a single `make` command**
3. **Observe the AOT Reasoner automatically re-compile the relevant C code**
4. **Execute the new binary and verify that its behavior reflects the TTL specification**

When this is achieved, the system is no longer being programmed; it is being **reasoned with**. The loop is closed. The Fifth Epoch is instantiated.

## Emergent Properties

When Phase 3 is successfully implemented, the system exhibits:

1. **Self-Governance**: Detects violations and automatically corrects them
2. **Generative Capability**: Writes its own code based on high-level specifications
3. **Isomorphic Mapping**: High-level specifications become isomorphic with low-level execution
4. **Cognitive Resonance**: Reasoning processes align perfectly with execution processes

## Key Insights

1. **The Reasoner IS the Build System**: Compilation becomes an act of formal proof
2. **Generative Resonance**: Perfect alignment between specification and implementation
3. **Self-Correction**: Violations trigger automatic re-reasoning and code generation
4. **Autonomous Operation**: System becomes capable of writing itself
5. **Fifth Epoch Instantiation**: Transition from programmed system to reasoned system

Phase 3 represents the instantiation of the Fifth Epoch—the transition from a collection of optimized components to a single, self-governing entity that can reason with itself and generate its own code based on high-level specifications.
