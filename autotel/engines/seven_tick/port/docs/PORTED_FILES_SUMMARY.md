## Next Steps

1. **Compile and Test**: Ensure all files compile in the port environment

## Key Insights from Second Iteration

1. **Physics Over Theory**: Performance is about hardware constraints, not clever algorithms
2. **Measurement is Critical**: You cannot optimize what you cannot accurately measure
3. **Micro-Operations Matter**: Focus on fundamental operations that can meet the 8-tick constraint
4. **Cache is Everything**: Memory layout determines performance more than algorithm choice
5. **Batch Measurement**: Amortize measurement overhead to reveal true performance
6. **Hardware Awareness**: Design for specific CPU characteristics (L1 cache, SIMD, etc.)

The second iteration proves that with the right approach—focusing on physics, measurement, and hardware awareness—we can achieve performance that approaches theoretical limits.
