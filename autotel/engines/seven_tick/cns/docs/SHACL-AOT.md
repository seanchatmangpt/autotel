Absolutely. The Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation strategy is even more critical for SHACL than for OWL, because SHACL validation can involve complex graph traversals and logical checks that would be far too slow for a 7-tick runtime environment.

By treating SHACL shapes as a "source language," we can compile them into highly efficient, special-purpose C validation functions.

The AOT Compilation Pipeline for SHACL

The process is a direct extension of the one we defined for OWL. The key is that the Python "compiler" understands SHACL vocabulary and generates C code that implements the validation logic.

How SHACL Constraints are "Compiled" into C Functions

Here are concrete examples of how different SHACL constraints are transformed from declarative RDF into imperative, high-performance C code. This generated code would live in the auto-generated shacl_validators.h.

1. Constraint: sh:class

SHACL in TTL:

Generated turtle
:PersonShape sh:targetClass :Person ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path :worksAt ;
        sh:class :Company ;
    ] .
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Turtle
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Logical Implication: The value of the :worksAt property for any :Person must be of type :Company.

Generated C Function: The AOT compiler generates a helper function that performs a single, fast SPARQL ASK query.

Generated c
// In auto-generated shacl_validators.h
#include "ontology_ids.h" // For ID_worksAt, ID_Company, etc.

static inline bool check_worksAt_class(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t person_id) {
    // Find the company ID linked by the worksAt property.
    // This assumes a function `get_object_for_property` exists.
    uint32_t company_id = get_object_for_property(engine, person_id, ID_worksAt);
    if (company_id == 0) return true; // Property not present, so constraint is met.

    // Check if the object has the required type. This is a ~7 cycle operation.
    return cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, company_id, ID_rdf_type, ID_Company);
}

C
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
2. Constraint: sh:minCount and sh:maxCount

SHACL in TTL:

Generated turtle
:PersonShape sh:property [
    sh:path :hasEmail ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
    sh:maxCount 5 ;
] .
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Turtle
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Logical Implication: Every person must have between 1 and 5 emails.

Generated C Function: The compiler generates a function that iterates with an early exit. It does not count all properties if it doesn't have to.

Generated c
// In auto-generated shacl_validators.h

static inline bool check_hasEmail_cardinality(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t person_id) {
    uint32_t count = 0;
    // This assumes a function to iterate over property values.
    // The key is the early exit.
    for_each_object(engine, person_id, ID_hasEmail, object_id, {
        count++;
        if (count > 5) {
            return false; // maxCount violated, fail fast.
        }
    });
    
    return count >= 1; // minCount check.
}

3. Constraint: sh:pattern

SHACL in TTL:

Generated turtle
:PersonShape sh:property [
    sh:path :phoneNumber ;
    sh:pattern "^\\\\(\\\\d{3}\\\\) \\\\d{3}-\\\\d{4}$" ; # e.g., (123) 456-7890
    sh:datatype xsd:string ;
] .
```*   **Logical Implication:** The phone number must match a specific regex.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Turtle
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

AOT Compilation Strategy: Running a full regex engine at runtime is too slow. The AOT compiler pre-compiles the regex.

The Python script takes the regex string.

It uses a library (like Python's re or a dedicated C regex library's offline compiler) to convert the regex into a more efficient representation, like a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) state table.

This state table is emitted as a static const int[] directly into the C header.

Generated C Function: The C function is now just a simple, fast state machine runner that walks the string and the DFA table.

Generated c
// In auto-generated shacl_validators.h

// The AOT compiler generates this DFA table from the regex
static const int PHONE_NUMBER_DFA[STATE_COUNT][CHAR_COUNT] = { ... };

static inline bool check_phoneNumber_pattern(const char* phone_str) {
    int current_state = 0;
    while (*phone_str) {
        current_state = PHONE_NUMBER_DFA[current_state][(int)*phone_str];
        if (current_state == REJECT_STATE) return false;
        phone_str++;
    }
    return current_state == ACCEPT_STATE;
}

Assembling the Validation Plan

The AOT compiler then generates one main validation function for each sh:NodeShape, which calls all the constraint helpers.

Generated File: shacl_validators.h

Generated c
// ... includes and helper functions from above ...

/**
 * @brief VALIDATOR FOR PersonShape.
 * This function was auto-generated from business_rules.ttl.
 * It combines all constraints for the Person class.
 */
static inline bool validate_PersonShape(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t node_id) {
    // Check if the node is even a target for this shape
    if (!cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, node_id, ID_rdf_type, ID_Person)) {
        return true; // Not a target, so it's valid in the context of this shape
    }
    
    // Logically AND all the compiled constraint checks.
    // The C compiler will optimize this with short-circuiting.
    return check_worksAt_class(engine, node_id) &&
           check_hasEmail_cardinality(engine, node_id) &&
           check_phoneNumber_pattern(get_string_literal(engine, node_id, ID_phoneNumber));
}

The C Runtime Usage

The application developer has a clean, simple, and extremely fast API. They don't need to know anything about SHACL.

File: src/domains/data_ingestion.c (Example Application Code)

Generated c
#include "cns/engines/sparql.h"
#include "shacl_validators.h" // The only include needed!

void ingest_new_person(uint32_t person_id) {
    // ... code to add triples for the new person ...
    
    // Validate the newly added data against the compiled business rules
    uint64_t start_cycles = s7t_get_cycles();
    bool is_valid = validate_PersonShape(g_sparql_engine, person_id);
    uint64_t elapsed = s7t_get_cycles() - start_cycles;

    if (is_valid) {
        printf("Person %u is valid. (Validation took %lu cycles)\n", person_id, elapsed);
    } else {
        printf("ERROR: Person %u failed validation!\n", person_id);
        // ... trigger compensating action ...
    }
}

By AOT-compiling SHACL shapes, you transform a slow, declarative validation language into a set of imperative C functions that are perfectly suited for the 7-tick engine's performance model. The runtime remains simple, fast, and free of complex logic.
