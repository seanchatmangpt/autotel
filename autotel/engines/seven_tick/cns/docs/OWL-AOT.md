Excellent. Focusing on the C implementation is the right approach. This is where the "magic" of the Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation pays off.

To maximize the AOT usage of owl-rl, we will design the C-level components to consume the pre-computed, materialized output of the reasoner. The C code will have zero knowledge of OWL axioms at runtime. It will only know about simple data lookups and pre-generated validation functions.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the C implementation strategy and the functions/macros that would be generated.

The Core Philosophy: The "Reasoner" is the Build System

At runtime, there is no OWL reasoner. The C code is deliberately "dumb" and fast. The intelligence resides in the offline Python scripts that generate two key artifacts for the C environment:

A Materialized Triple Set: The owl-rl script takes the input ontology, computes all possible inferences (the deductive closure), and outputs a simple, flat list of all triples (both asserted and inferred). The C engine just loads this complete set of facts.

A Generated C Header (ontology_rules.h): For more complex or frequently used logical checks, the Python script generates highly-optimized, inline C functions that bake the OWL semantics directly into the code.

The Interface: How the AOT Output is Consumed in C

The owl-rl process generates a mapping from URI strings to uint32_t IDs. The C code works exclusively with these IDs.

Generated File: ontology_ids.h

#endif // ONTOLOGY_IDS_H

How Common OWL Axioms are "Compiled" into C Functions

Here are concrete examples of OWL axioms and the highly-optimized C functions that the AOT process would generate. These functions would live in the auto-generated ontology_rules.h.

1. Axiom: rdfs:subClassOf

OWL in TTL:

Generated turtle
cns:Manager rdfs:subClassOf cns:Employee .
cns:IndividualContributor rdfs:subClassOf cns:Employee .
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Turtle
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Logical Implication: If X is a Manager OR X is an IndividualContributor, then X is also an Employee.

Generated C Function: The AOT compiler generates a function that performs a simple, short-circuiting boolean check against the pre-computed types.

Generated c
// In auto-generated ontology_rules.h
#include "cns/engines/sparql.h"
#include "ontology_ids.h"

/**
 * @brief Checks if a subject is an Employee, including subclasses.
 * @return true if the subject is of type Employee, Manager, or IndividualContributor.
 */
static inline bool is_Employee(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t subject_id) {
    // This is hyper-fast. Each 'ask' is a ~7 cycle operation.
    // The || ensures short-circuiting for immediate exit on match.
    return cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, subject_id, ID_rdf_type, ID_Employee) ||
           cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, subject_id, ID_rdf_type, ID_Manager) ||
           cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, subject_id, ID_rdf_type, ID_IndividualContributor);
}
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

2. Axiom: owl:inverseOf

OWL in TTL:

Generated turtle
cns:manages owl:inverseOf cns:isManagedBy .
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Turtle
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Logical Implication: If A manages B, then it is also true that B isManagedBy A.

Generated C Function: The AOT compiler generates a function that checks for both the stated and the inferred relationship.

Generated c
// In auto-generated ontology_rules.h

/**
 * @brief Checks if manager_id manages employee_id, considering inverse properties.
 * @return true if (manager_id manages employee_id) OR (employee_id isManagedBy manager_id).
 */
static inline bool check_manages_relationship(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t manager_id, uint32_t employee_id) {
    return cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, manager_id, ID_manages, employee_id) ||
           cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, employee_id, ID_isManagedBy, manager_id);
}
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy

Use code with caution.
C
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
3. Axiom: owl:SymmetricProperty

OWL in TTL:

Generated turtle
cns:worksWith rdf:type owl:SymmetricProperty .
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Turtle
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Logical Implication: If A worksWith B, then it is also true that B worksWith A.

Generated C Function:

Generated c
// In auto-generated ontology_rules.h

/**
 * @brief Checks if person1 works with person2, considering symmetry.
 */
static inline bool check_worksWith_relationship(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t person1_id, uint32_t person2_id) {
    return cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, person1_id, ID_worksWith, person2_id) ||
           cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, person2_id, ID_worksWith, person1_id);
}
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
C
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
4. Axiom: owl:TransitiveProperty (The Most Powerful AOT Case)

OWL in TTL:

Generated turtle
cns:reports_to_transitively rdf:type owl:TransitiveProperty .
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Turtle
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Logical Implication: If A reports_to B and B reports_to C, then A reports_to_transitively C.

AOT Compilation Strategy: This is too complex for a simple inline C function. A runtime loop would violate the 7-tick rule. Instead, the owl-rl script pre-computes the entire transitive closure.

The Python script reads all reports_to triples.

It runs a graph traversal algorithm (like Floyd-Warshall or repeated squaring on an adjacency matrix) to find every single transitive relationship.

For each inferred relationship (e.g., (A, C)), it adds a new, explicit triple (A reports_to_transitively C) to the materialized triple set.

Generated C Function: The C function becomes trivial. It's just a single, fast lookup.

Generated c
// In auto-generated ontology_rules.h

/**
 * @brief Checks the pre-computed transitive closure for a reporting relationship.
 * @return true if the materialized fact exists.
 */
static inline bool check_reports_to_transitively(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t employee_id, uint32_t manager_id) {
    // The hard work was done at compile time. This is just one lookup.
    return cns_sparql_ask_pattern(engine, employee_id, ID_reports_to_transitively, manager_id);
}

How the C Runtime Uses the Generated Code

The final C application code is clean, semantic, and incredibly fast. Developers work with meaningful function names that hide the underlying complexity.

File: src/domains/hr_logic.c (Example Application Code)

Generated c
#include "cns/engines/sparql.h"
#include "ontology_rules.h" // The magic header!
#include "ontology_ids.h"

void process_employee_permissions(uint32_t employee_id) {
    // This call is inlined by the compiler and executes in ~15 cycles,
    // as it becomes two fast SPARQL 'ask' calls.
    if (is_Employee(g_sparql_engine, employee_id)) {
        printf("Processing permissions for Employee %u\n", employee_id);
    }

    if (is_Manager(g_sparql_engine, employee_id)) {
        printf("Applying manager-level permissions for %u\n", employee_id);
    }
}

void check_reporting_structure(uint32_t employee_id, uint32_t ceo_id) {
    // This check is a single, pre-computed lookup thanks to AOT reasoning.
    // It executes in ~7 cycles.
    if (check_reports_to_transitively(g_sparql_engine, employee_id, ceo_id)) {
        printf("Employee %u is in the CEO's reporting chain.\n", employee_id);
    }
}

By maximizing the Ahead-of-Time compilation of OWL, you achieve the best of both worlds: a rich, expressive semantic model for developers and a runtime engine that is stripped down to the bare essentials of data movement and bitwise logic, perfectly suited for the 7-tick performance guarantee.
