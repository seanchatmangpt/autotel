# CNS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is CNS?

CNS (Core Neural System) is a high-performance, 7-tick optimized CLI framework that integrates multiple specialized engines for semantic computing, validation, templating, and telemetry. It's designed to provide sub-microsecond performance for critical operations while maintaining a clean, domain-oriented interface.

### What does "7-tick" mean?

"7-tick" refers to the performance target of completing operations within 7 CPU cycles, which translates to approximately 10 nanoseconds on modern processors. This is an extremely aggressive performance target that ensures ultra-low latency for critical operations.

### What domains are supported?

CNS currently supports the following domains:
- **SPARQL**: Knowledge graph operations and triple pattern matching
- **SHACL**: Data validation and constraint checking
- **CJinja**: Template rendering with variable substitution
- **Telemetry**: Performance monitoring and distributed tracing
- **Benchmark**: Performance testing and validation

### Is CNS production-ready?

Yes, CNS 1.0.0 is production-ready with comprehensive testing, documentation, and performance validation. It has been designed with enterprise-grade features including error handling, performance monitoring, and cross-platform support.

## Performance Questions

### How fast is CNS?

CNS achieves the following performance targets:
- **L1 Tier (7-tick)**: < 10ns for critical operations
- **L2 Tier (sub-100ns)**: < 100ns for important operations
- **L3 Tier (sub-μs)**: < 1μs for complex operations

### How do you measure performance?

CNS uses high-precision cycle counting to measure performance:
- **Cycle Counting**: Uses CPU cycle counters (RDTSC on x86, PMCCNTR on ARM)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates min, max, average, percentiles
- **Validation**: Ensures operations meet 7-tick targets
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking

### What optimizations are used?

CNS employs multiple optimization strategies:
- **SIMD**: Vectorized operations using AVX2/NEON
- **Memory Layout**: Cache-friendly data structures
- **Hash-based Lookup**: O(1) command resolution
- **Minimal Allocation**: Stack-based and pool-based memory management
- **Branch Prediction**: Optimized control flow
- **Compiler Optimizations**: Profile-guided optimization

### How does CNS achieve 7-tick performance?

CNS achieves 7-tick performance through:
1. **Minimal Memory Access**: Optimized data structures and access patterns
2. **SIMD Optimizations**: Vectorized operations for parallel processing
3. **Hash-based Lookup**: O(1) command resolution using hash tables
4. **Stack Allocation**: Avoiding heap allocation for small objects
5. **Cache Optimization**: Aligning data to cache lines
6. **Branch Reduction**: Minimizing conditional branches in critical paths

## Architecture Questions

### What is the domain-command structure?

CNS uses a domain-command structure where each subsystem is a domain with specific commands:
```bash
cns <domain> <command> [options] [arguments]
```

For example:
- `cns sparql query "SELECT ?s WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }"`
- `cns shacl validate data.ttl shapes.ttl`
- `cns cjinja render "Hello {{name}}!" name=World`

### How is CNS organized internally?

CNS is organized into several layers:
1. **CLI Layer**: Command-line interface and argument parsing
2. **Domain Layer**: Domain-specific engines (SPARQL, SHACL, etc.)
3. **Core Layer**: Command parsing, dispatch, and execution
4. **Performance Layer**: Cycle counting and performance monitoring
5. **Platform Layer**: Platform-specific optimizations

### How does command dispatch work?

CNS uses a hash-based dispatch system:
1. **Command Registration**: Commands are registered with their handlers
2. **Hash Calculation**: Command names are hashed for O(1) lookup
3. **Hash Table**: Commands are stored in a hash table
4. **Lookup**: Commands are resolved by hash value
5. **Execution**: Handlers are called directly via function pointers

## Installation and Setup
