# 8T Coordinator Summary - Implementation Complete

## What Was Accomplished

The 8T-Lead coordinator successfully created and organized the 8T prototype directory structure following the 80/20 principle.

### Directory Structure Created ✓

```

```

### Files Created

1. **Headers (4 files)**
   - `include/cns/8t/types.h` - Core types (tick_t, triple_t, etc.)
   - `include/cns/8t/core.h` - Core API functions
   - `include/cns/8t/interfaces.h` - Component interfaces
   - `include/cns/8t.h` - Main 8T header

2. **Source Files (6 files)**
   - `src/8t/core/core.c` - Core engine with metrics
   - `src/8t/parser/parser.c` - State machine parser
   - `src/8t/cache/cache.c` - LRU cache with hash buckets
   - `src/8t/scheduler/scheduler.c` - Work-stealing scheduler
   - `src/8t/materializer/materializer.c` - Graph materialization
   - `src/8t/monitor/monitor.c` - Performance monitoring

3. **Test Files (1 file)**
   - `tests/8t/unit/test_core.c` - Core unit tests

4. **Benchmark Files (1 file)**
   - `benchmarks/8t/parser/bench_parser.c` - Parser performance

5. **Documentation (2 files)**
   - `8T_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed implementation plan
   - `8T_COORDINATOR_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Key Design Features

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Clean component interfaces
   - Easy to swap implementations
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **80/20 Implementation**
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Essential features only
   - Room for optimization

3. **Performance Focus**
   - Lock-free designs where possible
   - Cache-friendly data structures
   - SIMD-ready architecture

### Integration Notes

- Found existing `Makefile.8t` with comprehensive build system
- Existing 8T source files include advanced components:
  - `arena_l1.c` - L1-optimized arena
  - `numerical.c` - Numerical operations
  - `graph_l1.c` - L1-optimized graph
  - `parser_branchless.c` - Branchless parser

### Coordination Complete

The 8T directory structure and placeholder implementations are ready for the development team to begin full implementation. The modular design allows different agents to work on components in parallel.
