## What Do Users Actually Need? (80/20 Analysis)

### High-Value Features (80% benefit)
1. **Graph Algorithms on Binary Format** - Run BFS/DFS without deserializing
2. **Quick Metadata Access** - Get stats without loading entire graph
3. **Incremental Updates** - Modify without full rewrite
4. **Range Queries** - Find nodes by ID range or property

### Medium-Value Features (15% benefit)
5. Compression (storage savings)
6. Schema evolution (versioning)
7. Parallel processing (multi-core)
8. Network protocol (distributed)

### Low-Value Features (5% benefit)
9. Custom allocators
10. Exotic graph types
11. Complex indexing
12. Full-text search

## The 80/20 Winner: Direct Graph Algorithms

**Why this is the killer feature:**
- Users can analyze graphs WITHOUT deserializing
- Works on graphs larger than RAM
- Leverages our ultra-fast node access
- Natural extension of current design

**What we'll implement:**
1. BFS (breadth-first search)
2. DFS (depth-first search)  
3. Connected components
4. Basic statistics (degree distribution)

**Implementation approach:**
- Work directly on memory-mapped format
- Use our 0-2 cycle node access
- Minimal memory allocation
- Cache-friendly traversal patterns
