# 8T Implementation Plan - 80/20 Approach

## Overview
The 8T (8-Tick) system is designed as an evolution of the 7-tick architecture with enhanced parallelism, caching, and modular design. This implementation follows the 80/20 principle - focusing on the 20% of features that deliver 80% of the value.

## Core Components (80/20 Focus)

### 1. Core Engine (✓ Implemented)
- Tick processing pipeline
- Component registration
- Metrics collection
- Thread-safe operations

### 2. Parser (✓ Implemented)
- State machine design
- Fast TTL/N-Triples parsing
- Minimal memory allocation
- Stream processing capability

### 3. Cache (✓ Implemented)
- LRU eviction policy
- Lock-free read path
- Hash-based lookup
- Configurable size

### 4. Scheduler (Placeholder)
- Work-stealing queue
- Priority-based scheduling
- Batch optimization
- Thread pool management

### 5. Materializer (Placeholder)
- Graph construction
- Query execution
- Index management
- Result streaming

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture
- Component interfaces allow swapping implementations
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy testing and benchmarking

### 2. Zero-Copy Design
- Minimize data copying
- Use pointers and references
- Stream processing where possible

### 3. Cache-Friendly
- Data structures optimized for cache lines
- Hot/cold data separation
- Prefetching hints

### 4. Parallelism First
- Lock-free data structures where possible
- Fine-grained locking when needed
- Batch processing for amortization

## Performance Targets

Based on the 80/20 principle, focusing on:
1. **Parser**: > 1M triples/second
2. **Cache**: > 10M lookups/second
3. **Scheduler**: < 100ns task dispatch
4. **Overall**: 8x improvement over baseline

## Build and Test

```bash
# Build the 8T library
make -f Makefile.8t all

# Run unit tests
make -f Makefile.8t test

# Run benchmarks
make -f Makefile.8t benchmark

# Clean build artifacts
make -f Makefile.8t clean
```

## Integration with CNS

The 8T system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing CNS infrastructure:
- Compatible with existing graph structures
- Reuses arena allocator
- Integrates with telemetry system
- Supports existing binary formats

## Next Implementation Priority

1. **Scheduler** - Critical for parallel performance
2. **Materializer** - Core query execution
3. **Monitor** - Performance visibility
4. **Integration** - Connect all components

This 80/20 implementation provides a solid foundation with the most critical components implemented first, allowing for rapid iteration and performance validation.
