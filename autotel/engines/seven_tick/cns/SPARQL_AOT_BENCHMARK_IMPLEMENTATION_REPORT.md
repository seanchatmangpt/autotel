### Kernel Functions Implemented
```c
// 7-tick optimized kernel implementations
int s7t_scan_by_type(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t type_id, uint32_t* results, int max_results);
int s7t_scan_by_predicate(CNSSparqlEngine* engine, uint32_t pred_id, uint32_t* results, int max_results);
int s7t_simd_filter_gt_f32(float* values, int count, float threshold, uint32_t* results);

- **Interpreted queries**: Direct kernel calls with runtime pattern matching
- **AOT queries**: Pre-compiled query execution plans with micro-operation tapes
- **Performance comparison**: AOT queries show consistent performance improvements

### Dataset Management
- **Realistic data distribution**: 40% persons, 30% documents, 20% customers, 10% organizations
- **Relationship density**: 20% social connections, realistic creator/member relationships
- **Cache-friendly layout**: Contiguous memory allocation for optimal performance

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### ARM64/M1 Mac Support
- Successfully resolved SIMD intrinsic conflicts
- Proper compiler flag management for ARM64 architecture
- Native Apple Silicon optimization with `-mcpu=apple-m1`

### Architecture Detection
```c
// CPU cycle measurement with architecture detection
#if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(__i386__)
    // RDTSC instruction for x86/x64
#elif defined(__aarch64__)
    // ARM64 cycle counter
#else
    // Fallback to high-precision timer
#endif
```
