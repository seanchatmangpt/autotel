Engine Integration Utilities

Cross-engine integration utilities that enable PicosecondSPARQL to work
seamlessly with other Autotel components and external systems.

Components:
- owl_picosparql.py: OWL ontology integration with PicosecondSPARQL
- dspy_picosparql.py: DSPy framework integration for LLM workflows
- bpmn_picosparql.py: BPMN workflow integration for semantic reasoning

Key Features:
- Seamless integration with existing Autotel ecosystem components
- Performance-optimized integration patterns for minimal overhead
- Standardized integration APIs for consistent usage patterns
- Cross-system data format conversion and optimization
- Integration testing and validation frameworks

Integration Categories:
1. Semantic Systems: OWL, RDF, ontology reasoning engines
2. ML/AI Frameworks: DSPy, neural networks, machine learning pipelines
3. Workflow Systems: BPMN, process automation, task orchestration
4. Data Systems: Databases, data lakes, streaming platforms
5. External APIs: REST services, GraphQL endpoints, messaging systems

Performance Considerations:
- Zero-copy data sharing where possible between integrated systems
- Efficient serialization and deserialization for data exchange
- Connection pooling and resource management for external systems
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed external data
- Parallel processing for independent integration operations

Integration Patterns:
- Adapter pattern for external system compatibility
- Facade pattern for simplified integration interfaces
- Observer pattern for real-time data synchronization
- Strategy pattern for different integration approaches
- Factory pattern for dynamic integration creation

Use Cases:
- Semantic reasoning in machine learning workflows
- Real-time data validation in BPMN processes
- Ontology-driven query optimization and validation
- Cross-system data integration and synchronization
- Hybrid reasoning combining symbolic and neural approaches

Quality Assurance:
- Comprehensive integration testing with mock and real systems
- Performance benchmarking for all integration points
- Compatibility testing with different system versions
- Error handling and recovery for integration failures
- Security validation for cross-system data exchange
