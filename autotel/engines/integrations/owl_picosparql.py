OWL Ontology Integration with PicosecondSPARQL

Seamless integration between OWL ontology reasoning and PicosecondSPARQL
for enhanced semantic reasoning capabilities in Autotel workflows.

Key Features:
- High-performance OWL reasoning with PicosecondSPARQL query execution
- Ontology-driven query optimization and validation
- Real-time consistency checking and inference
- Scalable reasoning for large ontologies and datasets
- Integration with Autotel's semantic processing capabilities

Integration Capabilities:
1. Ontology Loading: Efficient loading and indexing of OWL ontologies
2. Inference Integration: Combining reasoning results with SPARQL queries
3. Consistency Checking: Real-time validation using ontological constraints
4. Query Enhancement: Automatic query expansion using ontological knowledge
5. Performance Optimization: Ontology-guided query optimization

Reasoning Features:
- Incremental reasoning for dynamic ontology updates
- Materialization strategies for large-scale inference
- Selective reasoning for performance-critical scenarios
- Parallel reasoning for independent inference tasks
- Caching of inference results for repeated queries

OWL Support:
- Full OWL 2 DL support with optimized reasoning algorithms
- OWL 2 profiles (EL, QL, RL) with specialized optimizations
- Custom ontology extensions for domain-specific reasoning
- SWRL rules integration for enhanced inferencing
- Ontology modularization for scalable reasoning

Performance Optimizations:
- Lazy loading of ontology components based on query requirements
- Incremental classification and realization
- Optimized data structures for reasoning and querying
- Parallel reasoning using multiple CPU cores
- Memory-efficient reasoning for large ontologies

Integration Points:
- Used by AutotelPicosecondSPARQL for ontology-enhanced queries
- Works with GenerativeAssembler for ontology-guided query generation
- Integrates with Autotel workflows for semantic validation tasks
- Supports external ontology repositories and management systems

Use Cases:
- Semantic data validation in ETL pipelines
- Ontology-driven data integration and mapping
- Real-time consistency checking in data workflows
- Automated reasoning in decision support systems
- Knowledge graph construction and validation

Quality Assurance:
- Comprehensive testing with standard OWL test suites
- Performance benchmarking against established reasoners
- Correctness validation using ontology verification tools
- Integration testing with various ontology formats
- Scalability testing with large real-world ontologies

Configuration Options:
- Reasoning profile selection (DL, EL, QL, RL)
- Performance vs. completeness trade-offs
- Memory usage limits and optimization strategies
- Parallel reasoning configuration
- Caching and materialization policies

Error Handling:
