# AutoTel Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Automated Telemetry-Driven Workflow Orchestration System

### 1. Executive Summary

AutoTel is an **XML-driven workflow orchestration system** that enables end users to define, execute, and monitor business processes using only XML configuration files. The system automatically generates comprehensive telemetry (spans, traces, events) for all workflow activities, providing complete observability into process execution.

**Core Value Proposition:** Enable non-technical users to create sophisticated, AI-powered business workflows using XML configuration, with automatic telemetry generation for complete process visibility.

### 2. Problem Statement

#### Current Challenges:
- **Technical Barrier:** Business users cannot create or modify workflows without developer assistance
- **Observability Gap:** Limited visibility into workflow execution and performance
- **Integration Complexity:** Difficult to integrate AI reasoning, business rules, and data validation
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Proprietary workflow engines with limited customization
- **Telemetry Disconnect:** Workflow execution lacks comprehensive observability

#### Target Users:
- **Business Analysts:** Need to create/modify business processes
- **Process Owners:** Need visibility into workflow performance
- **Operations Teams:** Need to monitor and troubleshoot workflows
- **Compliance Teams:** Need audit trails and validation

### 3. Solution Overview

AutoTel provides a **declarative XML-based workflow system** with five integrated pillars:

1. **BPMN (Process Orchestration):** Define workflow structure and flow
2. **DMN (Business Rules):** Define decision logic and business rules
3. **DSPy (AI Reasoning):** Define AI-powered reasoning and analysis
4. **SHACL (Data Validation):** Define data shapes and validation rules
5. **OWL (Ontology):** Define domain knowledge and relationships

**Key Innovation:** All five pillars are defined in XML, with automatic telemetry generation for every activity.
