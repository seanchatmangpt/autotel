# Top-level schema documentation

# This LinkML schema defines the structure of a workflow-level OpenTelemetry span for AutoTel BPMN+DMN workflows.
# It is designed to capture all relevant telemetry for workflow execution, including span hierarchy, events, attributes, and workflow-specific metadata.
# Example use cases: exporting workflow traces, validating telemetry, or generating documentation for observability tools.
