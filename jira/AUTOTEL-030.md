# AUTOTEL-030: Implement Data Validation

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** High  
**Sprint:** Phase 4  
**Category:** Validation  

## Description

Implement comprehensive data validation using SHACL shapes and XML schema validation.

## User Story

As a compliance team, I want all data to be validated against defined schemas so that I can ensure data quality and compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] XML files are validated against schemas
- [ ] Input data is validated against SHACL shapes
- [ ] Intermediate results are validated
- [ ] Output data is validated
- [ ] Validation errors provide clear messages
- [ ] Validation performance is < 50ms per check
- [ ] CDATA sections are prevented
- [ ] No hardcoded values in XML
- [ ] Cross-reference validation works
- [ ] Fail-fast validation behavior

## Technical Requirements

- Use XML schema validation
- Use pyshacl for SHACL validation
- Implement custom validators
- Add validation error reporting
- Optimize validation performance
- Prevent CDATA sections
- Validate cross-references
- Add validation telemetry

## Definition of Done
