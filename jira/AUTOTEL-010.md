# AUTOTEL-010: Implement Runtime Workflow Execution

**Type:** Story  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Sprint:** Phase 1  
**Category:** Execution  

## Description

Implement the core workflow execution engine that can run BPMN workflows with all five pillars integration.

## User Story

As a system, I want to execute BPMN workflows with integrated DMN, DSPy, SHACL, and OWL components so that business processes can be automated.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] BPMN process executes from start to end
- [ ] DMN business rules are evaluated
- [ ] DSPy services are called with proper signatures
- [ ] SHACL validation is performed on data
- [ ] OWL ontology validation is performed
- [ ] Workflow context is maintained throughout execution
- [ ] Error handling and recovery is implemented
- [ ] Execution results are returned
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 5 seconds for simple workflows)

## Technical Requirements

- Use SpiffWorkflow for BPMN execution
- Integrate DMN engine for business rules
- Call DSPy services with dynamic signatures
- Perform SHACL validation using pyshacl
- Perform OWL validation using rdflib
- Maintain workflow context and data flow
- Implement proper error handling
- Add telemetry spans for each activity

## Definition of Done

### For All Tickets:
- [ ] Code follows AutoTel coding standards
- [ ] No hardcoded values in XML
- [ ] No CDATA sections in XML
- [ ] Telemetry generated for all operations
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

### For Execution Tickets:
- [ ] Workflow executes end-to-end
- [ ] All five pillars integrated
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Performance meets requirements

## Dependencies

- AUTOTEL-011: DMN Integration
- AUTOTEL-012: DSPy Integration
- AUTOTEL-013: SHACL Integration
- AUTOTEL-014: OWL Integration

## Estimation

**Story Points:** 13  
**Effort:** 3-4 days

## Test Cases

- [ ] Execute simple BPMN workflow
- [ ] Execute workflow with DMN decisions
- [ ] Execute workflow with DSPy services
- [ ] Execute workflow with SHACL validation
- [ ] Execute workflow with OWL validation
- [ ] Execute complete five pillars workflow
- [ ] Handle execution errors gracefully
- [ ] Verify telemetry generation
