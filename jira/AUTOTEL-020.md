# AUTOTEL-020: Implement Telemetry Integration

**Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Sprint:** Phase 2  
**Category:** Telemetry  

## Description

Implement comprehensive telemetry generation for all AutoTel operations using OpenTelemetry standards.

## User Story

As an operations team, I want complete visibility into workflow execution so that I can monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Every workflow activity generates telemetry spans
- [ ] Process start/end events are tracked
- [ ] Task execution (service, user, business rule) is tracked
- [ ] Decision points and outcomes are tracked
- [ ] Data validation results are tracked
- [ ] AI reasoning steps are tracked
- [ ] Error conditions and exceptions are tracked
- [ ] Performance metrics are collected
- [ ] Telemetry can be exported to standard formats
- [ ] Telemetry overhead is < 100ms per activity

## Technical Requirements

- Use OpenTelemetry Python SDK
- Generate spans for all workflow activities
- Set appropriate span attributes
- Track parent-child span relationships
- Export telemetry to Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.
- Implement custom span processors
- Add performance monitoring
- Handle telemetry configuration

## Definition of Done

### For All Tickets:
- [ ] Code follows AutoTel coding standards
- [ ] No hardcoded values in XML
- [ ] No CDATA sections in XML
- [ ] Telemetry generated for all operations
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

### For Telemetry Tickets:
- [ ] OpenTelemetry spans generated
- [ ] Span attributes properly set
- [ ] Telemetry export working
- [ ] Performance impact < 100ms

## Dependencies

- AUTOTEL-021: Workflow Activity Telemetry
- AUTOTEL-022: Decision Point Telemetry
- AUTOTEL-023: Validation Telemetry
- AUTOTEL-024: Error Telemetry
- AUTOTEL-025: Telemetry Export

## Estimation

**Story Points:** 21  
**Effort:** 5-6 days

## Notes

Telemetry is critical for observability and compliance. This epic ensures that all AutoTel operations are fully observable and traceable.
