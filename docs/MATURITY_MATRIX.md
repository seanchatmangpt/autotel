## üîÆ Future Vision

The maturity matrix represents not just technical progression, but the evolution from a software framework to a living, breathing ontological operating system. Each level brings us closer to the vision of a self-constructing, self-verifying, and self-evolving computational environment where ontologies drive everything and telemetry is the only source of truth.
