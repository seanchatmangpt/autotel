# Operation Dogfood ‚Äì Autotel v8
## Program Charter

**Program Title:** Operation Dogfood  
**Program Code Name:** AUTOTEL V8  
**Sponsor:** Founder (SRO Architect)  
**Program Manager:** [You / Assigned]  
**Start Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Planned Completion:** [TBD ‚Äì Milestone-based]

## üéØ Mission Statement

To build a fully reflexive, ontologically-cached software system that simulates and compiles enterprise workflow at nanosecond resolution using OWL, SHACL, BPMN, Beam, Rust, Assembly, and Nuxt ‚Äî with telemetry as source of truth, not humans.

## üåç Vision

A self-constructing and self-verifying runtime for intelligent software generation.  
The world's first ontology-native compiler for business processes.

## üß± Objectives

| ID | Objective |
|----|-----------|
| OBJ-1 | Implement unified CLI: `autotel <domain> <verb>` across all 7+ domains |
| OBJ-2 | Execute the Scrum Reference Ontology (SRO) with BPMN sequencer + OTEL traces |
| OBJ-3 | Integrate Jinja2 with OWL/SHACL for reflexive rendering and validation |
| OBJ-4 | Prove Generative Assembly concept with nanosecond path selection |
| OBJ-5 | Run full-stack simulation from SRO ‚Üí Nuxt frontend in a single DAG |
| OBJ-6 | Telemetrically mutate ontologies via runtime OTEL spans |
| OBJ-7 | Package a developerless simulation and deployment MVP |

---

## üß© Scope

### In Scope:
- Unified Ontological Runtime (OWL + SHACL as base)
- BPMN DAG execution + DSL
- DSPy XML agent activation
- OpenTelemetry-first instrumentation
- JIT rendering via Jinja2
- Rust + Beam concurrency + assembly hotpaths
- End-to-end Nuxt generation pipeline
- CLI-driven everything

### Out of Scope (for this release):
- Legacy integration
- Docker/cloud-first distribution
- Multi-user auth systems
- End-user frontend design polish

## üõ†Ô∏è Deliverables

| ID | Deliverable | Format |
|----|-------------|--------|
| D1 | Ontology Cache (SRO + TRIZ) | `ontologies/*.owl`, `*.shacl` |
| D2 | BPMN Orchestration Engine | `processors/bpmn/` |
| D3 | Autotel CLI | `autotel_cli.py`, full coverage |
| D4 | DSPy Inference XML | `signatures/*.xml` |
| D5 | Codegen Pipeline | Rust/Beam/Nuxt output |
| D6 | Trace-Driven Simulator | OpenTelemetry + feedback loop |
| D7 | Self-Verifying Test Suite | FactoryBoy + Telemetry Validators |

---

## üö¶ Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Workflow simulation from SRO ‚Üí frontend | < 1 sec |
| Telemetry trace coverage | 100% |
| Ontology mutation round-trip (OWL/SHACL ‚Üí Nuxt) | < 50 ms |
| Assembly hotpath integration | Proven for signal ops |
| No manual code artifacts | 100% generated |

---

## üß† Strategic Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Overly human-centric workflows | Simulate-only, no editing |
| Incoherent ontology mutation | Use SHACL to restrict illegal states |
| DSPy latency | Only used for signature scaffolding |
| Overhead in codegen | Use Nuxt + JIT beam DAG only |
| Lack of external validation | Use telemetry trace snapshots as truth |

---

## üß™ Validation Strategy

- **Ontology validation:** SHACL (always-on), no LinkML
- **Telemetry:** OpenTelemetry traces with full span fidelity
- **CLI:** All verbs must produce real, compilable artifacts
- **Snapshot testing:** BPMN ‚Üí Nuxt pipeline snapshots
- **Self-verifying:** Factory Boy tests + OWL/SHACL round-tripping

---

## üî≠ Long-Term Objectives (Post-v8)

- Full simulation of customer ontologies (HR, IT, Legal)
- Generative Assembly V2: code-as-cache from path prediction
- Reflexive Ontology Compiler (ROC)
- Autonomous JIT DAG scheduler
- Ontology Chain-of-Thought engine (OTEL-forward inference)
- 100% humanless software generation
