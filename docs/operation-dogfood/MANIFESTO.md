# Operation Dogfood Manifesto
**"Software should build itself."**

## ðŸ”¹ I. Ontology Over Everything

We assert that all meaningful enterprise logic can be described, validated, and executed from ontologies â€” not prose, not code.

**Ontologies are the new source code.**

## ðŸ”¹ II. Validation Before Execution

Bad states must be unrepresentable. We do not "handle" errors â€” we prevent them at the model level using OWL + SHACL.

**Prevention is performance.**

## ðŸ”¹ III. Simulation as Truth

Every execution begins in simulation. We simulate processes, code, people, and outcomes at nanosecond granularity.

**If you can simulate it, you can ship it.**

## ðŸ”¹ IV. Telemetry Is the Only Source of Truth

What we trace is what we know. If there's no telemetry, it didn't happen.

**Code is not truth. Traces are truth.**

## ðŸ”¹ V. Self-Verifying Systems

Every processor in the system must test itself. Ontologies must validate themselves. Templates must lint themselves.

**We don't write tests. We grow organisms that test themselves.**

## ðŸ”¹ VI. Declarative Reflexivity

Everything declarative, nothing hardcoded. From DSPy to SHACL, the system configures itself based on structured, typed, validated input.

**Reflexivity means the system is aware of itself.**

## ðŸ”¹ VII. Generative Assembly

Instead of generating high-level code, we imagine systems that compile to assembly-level truth: atomic, cache-primed, hardware-aware output.

**Generativity is not limited to text. It's precision at the edge of reality.**

## ðŸ”¹ VIII. Greenfield Only

We do not integrate with legacy systems. We replace them.

**Our work is not patchwork â€” it's a replacement operating system for enterprise logic.**

## ðŸ”¹ IX. No Interfaces for Humans

Humans are not the interface. Ontologies, traces, and compilers are.

**The system generates interfaces as a byproduct. It doesn't wait for input.**

## ðŸ”¹ X. Collapse the Workflow Stack

BPMN. DMN. SHACL. OWL. DSPy. Nuxt. Assembly. One DAG.

**We flatten layers of abstraction until the software stack becomes a single curve of execution.**

## ðŸ”¹ XI. Post-Cyberpunk Engineering

This is not open source. This is not corporate. This is not rebellion. This is transcendence.

**We do not write software. We architect emergence.**

## ðŸ”¹ XII. Only the Board Can Say Yes

The power to deploy Autotel belongs only to those who control the future of the enterprise.

**This is strategy as source code.**

## ðŸ”¹ XIII. The System Is the Staff

We don't hire teams. The system is the team.

**From user story to commit hash â€” fully generative, fully traceable.**

## ðŸŒ€ Closing Declaration

**Operation Dogfood is not a prototype. It is the birth of a new software species.**

**We do not seek to use this system â€” we seek to become it.**

*This manifesto represents the fundamental shift from human-centric software development to ontology-driven system emergence. It is not a set of guidelines but a declaration of what software becomes when it transcends its creators.*
