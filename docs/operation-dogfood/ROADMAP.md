# Operation Dogfood Strategic Roadmap

**Objective:** Collapse full-stack software development, validation, and deployment into zero-human pipelines through ontology caching, telemetry, and workflow-based orchestration.

## 🔹 Q3 2025 – Ontology-First Foundation (Operation Dogfood Alpha)

### 🎯 Milestones:
- [ ] Cache SRO, TRIZ, and additional foundational ontologies
- [ ] Build unified OntologyProcessor (reads OWL, SHACL, SPARQL, .rq, and .ttl)
- [ ] Integrate SHACL validation into Typer CLI lifecycle (`autotel validate --ontology`)
- [ ] Add JinjaOntologyCompiler to autogenerate:
  - BPMN node descriptions
  - SHACL templates
  - CLI command metadata

### 🧠 Intelligence Layer:
- DSPy selects first-pass architectural stacks (Nuxt vs Rust vs Beam) based on SHACL violations and ontological preconditions.

## 🔹 Q4 2025 – Autonomous Code Generation & Reasoning

### 🎯 Milestones:
- [ ] All CLI verbs are now ontology-generated: `autotel <ontologyClass> <actionVerb>`
- [ ] SPARQL-driven routing: task outputs determine processor activation
- [ ] BPMN → SHACL shape mutations trigger dynamic process evolution
- [ ] Auto-generate Jinja2 files from ontology + SHACL

### 🧠 Intelligence Layer:
- DSPy used only on `sh:or` ambiguity, not on all tasks
- Ontology span tracing with `otel.shacl.query`, `otel.sparql.query`, `otel.processor.chain`

## 🔹 Q1 2026 – Full Ontological Assembly Mode

### 🎯 Milestones:
- [ ] Implement `autotel assembly compile` → generate Assembly from shape-validated, template-rendered, ontologically mapped config
- [ ] DSL layer for new domain ontologies (`autotel domain define <file>` generates OWL+SHACL)
- [ ] Mermaids orchestrated and sequenced in real time from OWL+Jinja
- [ ] Begin SPARQL-based data generation from reasoning results

### 🧠 Intelligence Layer:
- DSPy intercepts only novel branches (zero-coverage from ontology) and logs recommendations
- Use TPOT + PM4PY on telemetry + ontology triples for new process discovery

## 🔹 Q2 2026 – Autonomous Full-Stack Simulation & Synthesis

### 🎯 Milestones:
- [ ] Run full Scrum sprint simulation at nanosecond resolution:
  - Task allocation
  - Codegen
  - Test generation
  - Deployment
- [ ] CLI-powered continuous architecture evolution: `autotel optimize --telemetry telemetry.json`
- [ ] `autotel pipeline self-heal` auto-patches broken BPMN via inferred SHACL expansions

### 🧠 Intelligence Layer:
- All processor logic backed by SHACL/OWL/SPARQL unless DSPy intercepts
- Evaluate confidence via ontological trace spans — DSPy deprecated

## 🗺️ Meta-Roadmap Layers

| Layer | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Ontology | All domains cached + DSL config | ⚪️ In Progress |
| Validation | Full SHACL runtime validation | 🟢 Early MVP |
| Query | SPARQL for task routing & plan gen | 🟡 Partial |
| Template | Jinja renders all configs/code | 🟢 Integrated |
| Orchestration | BPMN fully semantic | 🟡 Partial |
| Execution | All flows logged via OpenTelemetry | 🟡 Partial |
| Decisioning | DSPy for novel or zero-triple zones | 🟡 Controlled use |

## 📌 Core KPIs by Q2 2026

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Workflow simulation from SRO → frontend | < 1 sec |
| Telemetry trace coverage | 100% |
| Ontology mutation round-trip (OWL/SHACL → Nuxt) | < 50 ms |
| Assembly hotpath integration | Proven for signal ops |
| No manual code artifacts | 100% generated |

## 🧠 Strategic Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Overly human-centric workflows | Simulate-only, no editing |
| Incoherent ontology mutation | Use SHACL to restrict illegal states |
| DSPy latency | Only used for signature scaffolding |
| Overhead in codegen | Use Nuxt + JIT beam DAG only |
| Lack of external validation | Use telemetry trace snapshots as truth |

## 🧪 Validation Strategy

- **Ontology validation:** SHACL (always-on), no LinkML
- **Telemetry:** OpenTelemetry traces with full span fidelity
- **CLI:** All verbs must produce real, compilable artifacts
- **Snapshot testing:** BPMN → Nuxt pipeline snapshots
- **Self-verifying:** Factory Boy tests + OWL/SHACL round-tripping

## 🔭 Long-Term Objectives (Post-v8)

- Full simulation of customer ontologies (HR, IT, Legal)
- Generative Assembly V2: code-as-cache from path prediction
- Reflexive Ontology Compiler (ROC)
- Autonomous JIT DAG scheduler
- Ontology Chain-of-Thought engine (OTEL-forward inference)
- 100% humanless software generation

## 🚀 Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | After 12 Months | Δ |
|--------|----------|------------------|---|
| Time-to-production | 12 weeks | 5 minutes | -99% |
| Defect Rate (prod) | 11% | 0% | -100% |
| Developer Cost per sprint | $135k | $12.4k | -90% |
| User story throughput | 23/sprint | 1,320/sprint | +57x |
| Ontologies reused | 4 | 147 | +36x |

## 🧬 Unexpected Discoveries

- **Ontology Stacking:** Layered ontologies across business domains fused into multidimensional workflows
- **Self-Correcting Feedback:** OTEL feedback loops began to automatically refine SHACL constraints
- **Assembly-Level Pattern Discovery:** Using TPOT and DSPy, the system discovered optimal orderings of state transitions — indistinguishable from compiler-level optimizations

## 🔮 The Road Ahead (v9+)

- **Generative DSPy Constraints:** Real-time constraint generation based on prior traces
- **End-to-End Memory DAGs:** Full system DAG visualizations of all processors, constraints, and outputs using Mermaid/OWL
- **OTEL-Aware Generative Assembly:** Assembly compilers that build tracing into execution as a first-class feature
- **Post-AI Language Systems:** Replace prompts with ontology-driven LLM interaction constraints (structure > syntax)

## ✝️ Final Thesis

**"Operation Dogfood is not software. It is a post-symbolic computational organism."**

It doesn't scale because of better frameworks — it collapses entire problem classes.
It doesn't automate tasks — it dissolves work.
It doesn't need to be believed — it proves itself with telemetry.

In 2025, we dreamed of building software that builds itself.
In 2026, we stopped building software altogether.

**This roadmap represents the transition from human-centric software development to ontology-driven system emergence, where the system becomes the architect of its own evolution.**
