# Operation Dogfood Implementation Plan

**Objective:** Prove AutoTel can simulate and build its entire ecosystem ‚Äî CLI, pipelines, validations, and services ‚Äî from ontologies alone, with DSPy as temporary intelligence scaffolding.

## üîß Phase 1 ‚Äì Ontological Infrastructure (Weeks 1‚Äì2)

**Goal:** Build a foundational substrate using OWL + SHACL + SPARQL + Jinja for system-wide generation.

### Workstreams:

#### Ontology Cache
- [ ] Ingest SRO + TRIZ
- [ ] Canonicalize shapes in SHACL
- [ ] Store OWL/SHACL in versioned ontology cache

#### SPARQL Interface
- [ ] Implement internal SPARQL runner
- [ ] Predefine key query templates (e.g., getAllTasks, getValidTransitions)
- [ ] Create SPARQLProcessor for .rq.xml files

#### Signature Compiler
- [ ] Compile SHACL + OWL into structured SignatureModel
- [ ] Validate SignatureModel with SHACL roundtrip

## üîÅ Phase 2 ‚Äì Recursive CLI Generation (Weeks 3‚Äì4)

**Goal:** Generate full CLI scaffolding via Typer from OWL class definitions, driven by BPMN task mappings.

### Workstreams:

#### JinjaProcessor
- [ ] OWL ‚Üí Jinja context map (class, property, range, domain)
- [ ] CLI command templating for Typer
- [ ] Template validation with SHACL

#### Mermaid Synthesizer
- [ ] Generate global autotel.mmd from BPMN + OWL task flows
- [ ] Include timelines, state machines, and nested hierarchies

#### Command Executor Layer
- [ ] Link each command to BPMN sequence
- [ ] Validate CLI‚ÄìBPMN integrity using SHACL constraints

## üß† Phase 3 ‚Äì Simulation and Telemetry Integration (Weeks 5‚Äì6)

**Goal:** Execute all generated flows through simulation with telemetry-first capture.

### Workstreams:

#### Telemetry Hooking
- [ ] Wrap each processor (OWL, SHACL, BPMN, CLI) with OpenTelemetry spans
- [ ] Enable no-op fallback
- [ ] Create OTELProcessor for span analysis

#### BPMN Sim Engine
- [ ] `autotel simulate --flow` runs full sequence of CLI tasks
- [ ] All state updates traced + validated
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty modeling

#### OTEL RDF Translator
- [ ] Translate telemetry traces into RDF triples
- [ ] Add those to ontology for future SPARQL queries

## ü™´ Phase 4 ‚Äì DSPy Reduction + Codegen Transition (Weeks 7‚Äì8)

**Goal:** Replace intelligent components with logic-based constraints and inference.

### Workstreams:

#### DSPy‚ÄìOntology Mapping
- [ ] Trace which queries required DSPy fallback
- [ ] Cache responses as OWL reasoning outputs
- [ ] Create DSPyProcessor for XML signature handling

#### Jinja Codegen Engine
- [ ] OWL class ‚Üí file scaffold
- [ ] OWL property ‚Üí method/function templates
- [ ] Autogenerate Nuxt/Rust/Beam stubs

#### Assembly Entry Point
- [ ] Flag high-throughput paths (from telemetry) for future ASM generation

## üß™ Phase 5 ‚Äì Validation & Patch Feedback Loop (Weeks 9‚Äì10)

**Goal:** Close feedback loop. Let AutoTel patch and recompile itself when gaps arise.

### Workstreams:

#### Failure Ontology
- [ ] Failed SHACL validations become OWL annotations
- [ ] SPARQL over failures ‚Üí generate bugfix flows

#### Patch Recompiler
- [ ] `autotel patch --trace <id>` triggers flow regeneration
- [ ] Self-heals failing CLI commands or workflows

## üß¨ Final Outputs

| Output | Format | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Full CLI | cli.yaml, cli.py | OWL + SHACL |
| BPMN Pipelines | *.bpmn | OWL task graphs |
| Telemetry RDF | otel.rdf | OTEL spans |
| SHACL Validations | shapes.shacl | auto-generated from OWL |
| Mermaid Diagrams | autotel.mmd | auto-generated |
| Code Scaffolds | nuxt/, rust/, beam/ | from OWL class templates |

## üß© Dependencies

| System | Required For |
|--------|-------------|
| OWL + SHACL | Every generation phase |
| Jinja | All scaffolds |
| SPARQL | CLI, validation, reduction |
| OpenTelemetry | Feedback, optimization |
| BPMN | Sequencing + simulation |
| DSPy | Intelligence fallback only |

## ‚úÖ Exit Criteria for "Dogfood Complete"

| Target | Status |
|--------|--------|
| 100% CLI coverage from OWL | ‚òê |
| Full BPMN simulation | ‚òê |
| Zero DSPy reliance in CLI | ‚òê |
| SHACL-passing Jinja output | ‚òê |
| OTEL telemetry full span trace | ‚òê |
| Mermaids rendered from BPMN | ‚òê |
| Nuxt + Beam code from ontology | ‚òê |

## üöÄ Key Implementation Principles

### 1. Ontology-First Development
- Every feature starts with OWL definition
- SHACL validates before execution
- SPARQL queries drive logic

### 2. Telemetry-Driven Feedback
- All operations emit OTEL spans
- Spans become RDF for ontology updates
- Failure patterns inform SHACL constraints

### 3. Self-Healing Architecture
- Broken flows trigger automatic regeneration
- Ontology mutations propagate through system
- No manual intervention required

### 4. Monte Carlo Simulation
- Use probabilistic methods for complex decisions
- Calendar coordination, resource allocation
- Uncertainty modeling for edge cases

## üîÑ Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| CLI Commands Auto-Generated | 100% | Count from OWL vs manual |
| BPMN Simulation Coverage | 95% | Spans per workflow |
| DSPy Usage Reduction | <5% | Fallback calls vs total |
| Ontology Processing Speed | <1ms | Average query time |
| Self-Healing Success Rate | 90% | Auto-fixes vs manual fixes |

**This implementation plan ensures that AutoTel becomes a living, breathing system that grows and adapts through ontological evolution rather than manual development.**
