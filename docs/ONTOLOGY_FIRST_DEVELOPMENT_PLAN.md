# Ontology-First Development Planning Document

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

After applying 5 Whys analysis, we discovered that the fundamental issue is **paradigm mismatch**. We're trying to generate code from ontology instead of using ontology as the development environment itself. This document outlines the plan to build an ontology-first development platform where the ontology **is** the code.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)**

### Why 1: Why do we need code generation?
**Answer:** To eliminate manual naming and ensure consistency across systems.

### Why 2: Why do we need to eliminate manual naming?
**Answer:** Because developers create inconsistent, non-descriptive names that don't match domain language.

### Why 3: Why do developers create bad names?
**Answer:** Because they don't have access to the domain ontology as the source of truth during development.

### Why 4: Why don't developers have access to the ontology?
**Answer:** Because the ontology exists separately from the development workflow - it's not integrated into the coding process.

### Why 5: Why isn't the ontology integrated into development?
**Answer:** Because we're trying to **generate** code from ontology instead of **using** ontology as the development environment itself.

## 🧠 **Core Insight: Ontology IS the Development Environment**

### Current Paradigm (Wrong)
```
Ontology → Generate → Code → Use
```

### New Paradigm (Correct)
```
Ontology IS the code → Execute → Render Views
```

        self.graph = Graph()
        self.reasoner = Reasoner()
        self.bindings = {}
    
    def load_ontology(self, owl_content: str):
        """Load OWL ontology into runtime"""
        
    def get_class(self, class_uri: str) -> OntologyClass:
        """Get dynamic class from ontology"""
        
    def create_instance(self, class_uri: str, **properties) -> OntologyInstance:
        """Create instance of ontology class"""
```

#### **2. Dynamic Class Creation**
```python
class OntologyClass:
    def __new__(cls, class_uri: str, runtime: OntologyRuntime):
        """Dynamically create Python class from ontology"""
        
    def __init__(self, **properties):
        """Initialize with ontology properties"""
        
    def validate(self) -> bool:
        """Validate against SHACL constraints"""
```

```python
class LanguageAdapter:
    def generate_types(self, ontology_class: OntologyClass) -> str:
        """Generate language-specific type definitions"""
        
    def generate_serialization(self, ontology_class: OntologyClass) -> str:
        """Generate serialization code"""
        
    def generate_api_client(self, ontology_class: OntologyClass) -> str:
        """Generate API client code"""
```

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Immediate Next Steps**

   - Start with basic OWL loading
   - Add simple class creation
   - Test with existing ontologies

2. **Build Python adapter**
   - Dynamic class creation
   - Property access
   - Basic validation

3. **Create development workflow**
   - Edit ontology → See Python changes immediately
   - No code generation step
   - Direct execution

### **First Milestone (Week 2)**
```python
# Goal: This should work
runtime = OntologyRuntime("http://example.org/ontology")
runtime.load_ontology(owl_content)

# Create class dynamically
User = runtime.get_class("http://example.org/User")
user = User(name="John", email="john@example.com")

# Access properties
print(user.name)  # "John"
print(user.email)  # "john@example.com"

# Validate
assert user.validate()  # True if SHACL constraints pass
```

## 💡 **Key Principles**

1. **Ontology is the source of truth** - Everything derives from it
2. **No code generation** - Execute ontology directly
3. **Live development** - Changes reflect immediately
4. **Language agnostic** - Support multiple languages equally
5. **Type safety** - Maintain strong typing across languages
6. **Performance first** - Runtime performance is critical
7. **Developer experience** - Make ontology-first development natural

## 🔄 **Migration Strategy**

### **For Existing Projects**
1. **Extract ontology** from existing code
2. **Create ontology-first version** alongside existing code
3. **Gradual migration** of components
4. **A/B testing** of ontology vs generated code
5. **Full migration** once proven

### **For New Projects**
1. **Start with ontology** - Define domain model first
2. **Use ontology runtime** from day one
3. **Generate views** as needed (API docs, UI components)
4. **Iterate on ontology** - not on generated code
