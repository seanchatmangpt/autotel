# AutoTel

A fully reflexive, ontologically-cached software system that simulates and compiles enterprise workflow at nanosecond resolution using OWL, SHACL, BPMN, Beam, Rust, Assembly, and Nuxt ‚Äî with telemetry as source of truth, not humans.

## üéØ Mission Statement

AutoTel is the world's first ontology-native compiler for business processes. It represents the evolution from a software framework to a living, breathing ontological operating system where ontologies drive everything and telemetry is the only source of truth.

## üß¨ Systems Lineage

AutoTel inherits from three foundational systems engineering traditions:

- **Northrop Systems Thinking** ‚Üí CLI as Flight Control
- **RAND Decision Engineering** ‚Üí CLI as Policy Simulation Surface  
- **TAI Aerospace-Grade Automation** ‚Üí CLI as Automation Interface

## üöÄ Operation Dogfood

**Codename**: Self-Assembling Intelligence  
**Classification**: AutoTel Internal ‚Äì Ultra Priority

AutoTel is currently executing **Operation Dogfood** - a mission to simulate the entire ecosystem until the full software system assembles itself. All artifacts ‚Äî frontend, backend, ontology, validation, telemetry ‚Äî are derivable from simulation, not manually created.

### Mission-Critical Commands:
```bash
autotel simulate scrum
autotel simulate triz
autotel simulate autotel
autotel render jinja --context=state.json
autotel validate --owl=sro.owl --shacl=sro.shacl
autotel nuxt generate
autotel deploy fullstack
```

## üß© 7-Pillar Processor Architecture

AutoTel operates on a unified ontological runtime with seven core processors:

| Processor | Role | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **OWL** | Ontology Engine | Defines all conceptual boundaries and relationships |
| **SHACL** | Constraint Engine | Structural data contract enforcement |
| **BPMN** | Orchestration Engine | Temporal control graph and process sequencing |
| **DSPy** | Intelligence Engine | Generative augmentation and AI decision injection |
| **Jinja2** | Rendering Engine | Code and structure emission from templates |
| **OTEL** | Telemetry Engine | Observability and behavior graph backbone |
| **Nuxt** | Frontend Engine | UI/API gateway and execution target |

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/autotel.git
cd autotel

# Install dependencies using uv
uv sync

# Run the CLI
uv run autotel --help
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Validate a BPMN workflow
autotel bpmn validate workflows/sprint_flow.bpmn

## üß† Core Concepts

### Ontology-First Design
Every concept in AutoTel is defined, constrained, and validated by an ontology (OWL) and rules (SHACL). You can't build invalid software or misalign business logic.

### Execution-as-Ontology
All workflows (BPMN), decisions (DMN), validations (SHACL), intelligent behaviors (DSPy), templates (Jinja2), and telemetry (OTEL) are unified as ontology-backed processors.

### Simulation = Construction
By simulating workflows, you're not testing ‚Äî you are constructing. Every simulation writes telemetry, confirms validity, compiles templates, and builds frontends/APIs.

### Self-Describing, Self-Validating, Self-Evolving
When every component logs to OpenTelemetry and is backed by OWL+SHACL, you get continuous validation, live explainability, and immutable reasoning.

## üéØ Success Definition

‚úÖ You trigger one `autotel simulate autotel` and produce:
- Valid Nuxt frontend
- Valid OTEL telemetry graph
- Valid BPMN + DMN
- Valid SHACL outputs
- Working Rust/Assembly outputs
- All artifacts provable from OWL/SHACL simulation
- Zero manual coding

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run with telemetry validation
uv run pytest --telemetry-validate

# Run specific test suite
uv run pytest tests/test_factory_integration.py
```

## üö¶ Current Status

**Maturity Level**: 1 (Simulated Stack)

**Key Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ 7-pillar processor integration
- ‚úÖ SRO ontology implementation
- ‚úÖ Basic CLI framework
- ‚úÖ BPMN execution capability

**Next Milestone**: Level 2 (Telemetry-Aware AutoGen)

## ü§ù Contributing

AutoTel follows a strict ontological-first development approach:

1. **No manual code** - Everything must be generated from ontologies
2. **Telemetry as truth** - All validation through OpenTelemetry traces
3. **Simulation-driven** - Test by simulating, not by manual verification
4. **Ontology evolution** - All changes must be reflected in OWL/SHACL

## üß¨ Future Vision

AutoTel represents the evolution from software frameworks to living, breathing ontological operating systems. Each maturity level brings us closer to a self-constructing, self-verifying, and self-evolving computational environment where ontologies drive everything and telemetry is the only source of truth.
